After completing Pokemon Let's Go: Eevee i wanted to catch them all so I opened my pokedex, chose a pokemon and looked where to find it just to find out that its exculsive to pokemon Pikachu. I made this program so i could easily check if a pokemon i chose is in my game or not.

This program checks if the pokemon you searched for (by name or pokemon number) is in each of the games and tells you with the pictures present. if th letter is white, it is in your game.

This version does not have Meltan.
